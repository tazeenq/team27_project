**Name**: Tazeen Qureshi<br>
**DSI Cohort Number**: 04<br>
**Stream**: Data Science<br>
**Project Github**: https://github.com/tazeenq/team27_project<br>

## Description
This project analyzes the [Retail Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset) to see whether I can **classify whether a customer will be a high spender** based on their demographics (age, gender) and purchase attributes (product category, quantity).<br>

## Business Case
The retail industry in Canada is very competitive. In a competitive industry, it is essential to understand customer spending behaviors to execute optimized marketing strategies and guide strategic decision-making. Classifying customers as high spenders based on their demographics and purchase attributes can help businesses target the right audience and allocate their resources efficiently. 

## Questions and Answers
**1. What are they key variables and attributes in the dataset?**<br>

The key variables and attributes in the dataset are:<br>

- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.<br>
- **Date**: Date of the transaction.<br>
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.<br>
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.<br>
- **Age**: Age of the customer. <br>
- **Product Category**: Category of the product sold.<br>
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold in the transaction.<br>
- **Price per unit**: Price of one unit of the product.<br>
- **Total Amount**: Total transaction amount (calculated as Quantity x Price per unit).<br>

**2. How can we explore the relationships between different variables?**<br>
