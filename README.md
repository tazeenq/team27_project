# Team 27: Retail Sales Data Analysis

**Project Github**: https://github.com/tazeenq/team27_project


This is a project analyzing retail sales data [URL Path to the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset) to see whether I can **classify whether a customer will be a high spender** based on their demographics (age, gender) and purchase attributes (product category, quantity).
























## Potential Questions to Discuss When Reviewing Your Dataset
1. What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?

The key variables and attributes in the dataset are as follows:
- Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- Date: Date of the transaction.
- Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Gender: Gender of the customer.
- Age: Age of the customer. 
- Product Category: Category of the product sold.
- Quantity: Number of units sold in the transaction.
- Price per unit: Price of one unit of the product.
- Total Amount: Total transaction amount (calculated as Quantity x Price per unit).

2. How can we explore the relationships between different variables?

Initial plan is to use the following statistical methods to explore relationships:
- Using mean, median, and standard deviation to understand central tendencies and variation in numerical variables (Age, Quantity, and Total Amount).
- Identifying correlations between numerical variables (Quantity, Price per unit, and Total Amount).
- Grouping data by demographic variables (Gender, Age) to analyze differences in spending behaviors and product preferences.
- Examining trends over time by grouping data by Date to explore seasonal or monthly patterns.
- Cross-tabulating (or bar charts) to compare categorical variables like Gender and Product category.

3. Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?


4. Who is the intended audience for our data analysis?


5. What is the question our analysis is trying to answer?


6. Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?


7. How can we iterate on our design to address feedback and make iterative improvements?


8. What best practices can we follow to promote inclusivity and diversity in our visualization design?


9. How can we ensure that our visualization accurately represents the underlying data without misleading or misinterpreting information?


10. Are there any privacy concerns or sensitive information that need to be addressed in our visualization?


11. What are the specific objectives and success criteria for our machine learning model?

Not Applicable.

12. How can we select the most relevant features for training our machine learning model?

Not Applicable.

13. Are there any missing values or outliers that need to be addressed through preprocessing?


14. Which machine learning algorithms are suitable for our problem domain?

Not Applicable.

15. What techniques can we use to validate and tune the hyperparameters for our models?

Not Applicable.

16. How should we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets?


17. Are there any ethical implications or biases associated with our machine learning model?

Not Applicable.

18. How can we document our machine learning pipeline and model architecture for future reference?

Not Applicable.

## Requirements
- Thoroughly understand your data and the business case for your analysis. What will the impact of your results be?
- Clean your data. Be confident in the decisions you have made while doing so (e.g. default handling of NULL values).
- Test out regression analyses (for Part 1) or machine learning models/data visualizations (for Part 2). It may take several tries before you are satisfied with your results and understand how you can provide the most insight.
- Make sure your code is well-commented and decisions are documented.
- Keep your README up to date. Not only is that easier than writing it all at the end of your project, it will help keep you on track and ensure your alignment with your business objective.
- Each team member must create, review, and merge a pull request.
- Record a 3-5 minute video (at the end of Part 2) reflecting on your experience. Answer the following questions:
    - What did you learn?
    - What challenges did you face?
    - How did you overcome those challenges?
    - If you had more time, what would you add?
    - What strengths do you bring to a team environment?
